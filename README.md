## Overview

Crypt Raider is an exciting course project developed for the Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games." The project aims to create an immersive gaming experience by building a crypt-themed level using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and C++ programming. Through the development process, participants will learn essential concepts and techniques in game development, making Crypt Raider an interactive and educational project.

## Project Plan

1. **Create Our Level Design (Including Lighting):** The project begins with level design, where participants create a crypt-themed environment using UE5's powerful tools. Lighting with Lumen will be used to enhance the atmosphere and ambiance of the crypt.

2. **Make a "Mover" Component for the Secret Doors:** Participants will implement a "mover" component responsible for handling the movement of secret doors within the crypt level.

3. **Make a "Grabber" Component for the Player:** The course covers the development of a "grabber" component that allows the player to interact with objects in the environment, adding a crucial gameplay element.

4. **Call the Grabber Functionality from Blueprint:** Students will learn to expose C++ functionality to Blueprints, enabling designers to use the grabber component in a visual scripting environment.

5. **Create a "Pressure Plate" Component:** The project introduces a "pressure plate" component that reacts to the player's actions, leading to events or changes in the game world.

## What You Will Learn

Through the development of Crypt Raider, participants will gain practical experience and knowledge in the following areas:

1. **Actor Components and Scene Components:** Students will learn how to create and use actor components and scene components to enhance the functionality of game objects.

2. **Lighting with Lumen:** The course will cover UE5's advanced lighting system, Lumen, to create realistic and visually stunning environments.

3. **Modular Level Design:** Participants will explore the principles of modular level design, enabling the creation of versatile and reusable assets.

4. **Line Tracing and Collisions:** Students will learn the concept of line tracing and how to handle collisions for player interaction and environmental events.

5. **Calling C++ Functions from Blueprint:** The project introduces the process of exposing C++ functions to Blueprints, allowing designers to leverage the power of C++ within visual scripting.
